# Putt More Base (source)

This is the actionscript only source code of my 2012 flash game Putt More Base. This a mini golf game with puzzle elements. Powered by Box2D physics engine.

It should still be alive in a couple of legacy web games sites like https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/595263 and https://www.kongregate.com/games/jaycsantos/putt-more-base

Here is a sample gameplay recording:

Leaving the pure source code as is without the visual and audio assets and excluding 3rd party libraries. Hoping this could help another soul one way or another and because why not.
